   "TranslatedInstructions": "To begin making Traditional Shahi Tukda Recipe - Hyderabadi Double Ka Meetha we will first make the rabri.Into a saucepan add milk, sugar and saffron strands.Stir to combine and bring the mixture to a brisk boil.\nAfter boiling for a few minutes turn the heat to low and simmer the milk mixture stirring continuously until it is reduced to three fourths of its original quantity.The condensation will cause the cream from the milk to settle on the sides and bottom of the pan.\nIt's important to keep scraping down the cream and adding it back to the condensing milk.The mixture will begin to thicken and get a creamy texture.\nIt is important to make sure towards the end of the condensing process to be close to the stove monitoring the milk and stirring it continuously.Note: The last stages are when the condensed milk can get burned at the bottom of the pan and completely alter the taste of the rabri.\nHence it is extremely crucial to ensure you stay close to the pan and keep stirring.Once the milk has reduced to half of its original quantity, turn off the heat.\nNow add the cardamom powder and the rose water to the rabri and stir well to combine.\nKeep aside.\nFor the sugar syrupInto a saucepan add water and sugar.\nStir util the sugar dissolves.\nAllow the sugar syrup to boil for a few minutes.\nAdd the cardamom powder and rose water, stir and turn off the heat.\nFor the toasted breadTrim the edges of 6 bread slices and cut them diagonally.\nPlace them on a preheated pan in batches.Drizzle ghee generously over the bread and flip the bread and toast it on the tawa until it golden and crisp on both sides.\nOnce done remove the bread from the pan and keep aside.To serve the Shahi TukdaDip the fried bread slices in the sugar syrup, drain and arrange it on the serving dish.\nPour the rabri over the bread slices and garnish with the chopped almonds and pistachios.\nServe Shahi Tukda immediately.\nServe Traditional Shahi Tukda Recipe - Hyderabadi Double Ka Meetha with a party meal of Nawabi Paneer Curry, Hyderabadi Vegetable Biryani and Tomato Onion Cucumber Raita.",
